There are files for each part of the assignment in the two folders.


Part 1 folder: It contains the Python scripts: 'main.py' is the main script, and each of the three classes are separate: 'Guest class.py,' 'Room class.py,' and 'Hotel class.py' - these all need to run before the main script. This folder also contains the Part1.md file which contains the documentation of the program. Kindly ignore the pycache folder.
 

Part 2 folder: The ipynb file that contains code and explaination for part 2 of the coursework is contained in a 'Re-sit part 2' jupyter file. Also available is the 'UK House Price Index' dataset. I specifically selected the 'Average Price' sheet from the dataset.
